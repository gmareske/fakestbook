Here are the long term goals for the openbook system:

- 100 jazz standards.
- 100 rock songs.
- 100 israeli songs.
- easy creation of Eb and Bb versions of the jazz book.
- a build system that allows the user to configure the build.
- complete dependencies management so that every build will be right.
- separate system to add the meta data of the tunes and the tunes themselves
	to a relational database.
	This system will automatically create the database tables if needed.
	many blobs per entry (ps, pdf, many pngs, ly, png) etc...
- all files at maturity 5.
- more checks that make sure that all files are the same.
- adding -d flag to lilypond so that it could emit dependency info.
- tags are added to the files and are inserted into the db.
- mobile app to show the tunes.
	in phone/pad version it should scroll the tune slowly so that the player
	could keep playing and not fiddle with the mobile device.

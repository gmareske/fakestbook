How to edit .mako files using the vim editor?
=============================================
- first make sure you have a ~/.vimrc file of your own.
	You can take /etc/vim/vimrc or /usr/share/vim/vim73/vimrc_example.vim
	or maybe even edit /etc/vim/vimrc (not recommended).
- add the next lines in your ~/.vimrc:
	filetype off
	set runtimepath+=/usr/share/lilypond/[lilypond_version]/vim/
	filetype on
	after this you can edit lilypond files with syntax highlighting.
- It seems that after the previous instructions .mako files also do lilypond
	highlighting. I don't really know why but I guess that the first
	two bullets are enough (I need to investigate this...)
- If you want to be able to edit in vim and get syntax highlighting you
	can use the modeline way in which you tell vim, on a file by
	file basis how to edit that file.
	Make sure that your .vimrc has the following lines:
	set modeline		" Allow files to configure vim behaviour when editing them
	set modelines=5		" First 5 lines of the file can have a modeline
	And then make sure that you have this line at the first 5 lines of your file...
	# vim: set filetype=lilypon :
- Another way to automatically edit all files with some extension (say .mako) using the
	'lilypond' file type is to put the next lines into your ~/.vimrc or as a file
	in ~/.vim/
========================================
if exists("did_load_filetypes")
	finish
endif
augroup filetypedetect
	au BufRead,BufNewFile *.ly.mako set filetype=lilypond
augroup END
========================================
	Last time I tried this it did not work and so I'm using the modeline method above
	(for other reasons as well since .mako files may have other stuff than lilypond
	in them...)

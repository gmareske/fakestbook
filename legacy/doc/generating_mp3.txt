I used to generate .mp3 files from .wav files which were themselves generated from the the midi files
using timidity. The problem with this approach is that the .wav file are huge, slow to create and
don't justify their own storage space or creation time. On the other hand I still want .mp3 files.

The solution now is to create .mp3 files directly from .midi files using timidity where I pipe the
output directly to lame(1). See the midi2mp3.pl script for more details.

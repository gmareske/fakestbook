If you want to build a single tune use this:
	$ make out/src/openbook/[tune_name].stamp
	this will build: ly, midi, ps, pdf, stamp

If you just want to build a pdf use this:
	$ make out/[tune_name.ly.mako].pdf
	this is guaranteed to build the pdf for the required tune
	but may also build other products as well (and currently does).

If you want to build all rock songs use this:
	$ make all_tunes_rock

If you want to build all jazz songs use this:
	$ make all_tunes_jazz

if you want to cut an external pdf use (you must have the external pdfs in the right place):
	$ make out/src/openbook/[tune_name].[0-9].pdf

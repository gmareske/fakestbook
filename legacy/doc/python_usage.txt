This document deals with which python version we use in openbook and why

We use python through virtual env and so all script can have
	#!/usr/bin/env python
and not
	#!/usr/bin/python3

We currently use python3
Specifially I use 3.5.2 on my machine but that is a technicality.

Why? 3 is better than 2 and and the 3 branch is mature stable and full of
stuff we want. 2 is over.

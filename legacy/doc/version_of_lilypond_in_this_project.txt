Discussion of the lilypond version needed for this project:

I really needed the features and bug fixes in 2.14.2 so I installed it on my own
machine at /local/tools on top of ubuntu 11.04/10

Then came 12.04 and 2.14.2 is there already. So my private version is no longer
neccessary.

The descision is to keep using the public version on ubuntu. This will make new
contributors happy and I think I can stick to the 2.14 feature set for now.

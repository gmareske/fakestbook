    My fun -- ny Va -- len -- tine
    Sweet co -- mic Va -- len -- tine
    You make me smile with my heart
    Your looks are laugh -- a -- ble
    Un -- pho -- to -- graph -- a -- ble
    Yet you're my fa -- vourite work of art

    Is your fi -- gure less than Greek
    Is your mouth a lit -- tle weak
    When you o -- pen it to speak
    Are you smart?

    But don't change a hair for me
    Not if you care for me
    Stay lit -- tle Va -- len -- tine stay
    Each day is Va -- len -- tine's day

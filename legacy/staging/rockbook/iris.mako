	DONE:
	- put in the meta data for this song
	- put the chords for this song
	- put in the lyrics for this song
	- put in special chord diagrams for this song
	TODO:
	- how do I put time change markings in the chord changes? I need for the intro which is a little
	bit more complicated than the rest of the song.
	- how do I annotate the number of repeats that each part needs to be repeated? for instance,
	the intro should be repeated twice.

	Chord progression:
	Intro
	Verse
	Verse
	Chorus
	Intro
	Verse
	Chorus
	Interlude
	Chorus

	In the end the bass line is ascending and then decending (twice):
	b4 cis d2 b4 a g2
